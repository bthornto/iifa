Please accept my sincere apologies for your recent experience with our Sweet Greens with Lemon juice.  The quality of our products is of paramount importance to us and our ultimate goal is to produce the freshest, safest, and most nutritious juices on the market today.     As for the issue with the taste, rest assured that I will share your concerns with our Quality Assurance department so they are made aware of your feedback.

What I can offer, is a coupon to be used at a grocery store to try a different blend.  Or, if you have a Starbucks card that is registered in their rewards program, I can supply a credit to that card for you.   If you reply with your address I will get that sent to you, or if you reply with your full 16 digit Starbucks card number, I will get that credited.
